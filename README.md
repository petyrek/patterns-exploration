# stuff at works here

- no default exports to help avoid name inconsistencies
- union types using daggy.js
- fantasy-land ADTs from sanctuary
- observable monad (rxjs) to abstract backend data source
- firebase (though this architecture is server-agnostic, anything could be used instead)
- higher order functions/components
